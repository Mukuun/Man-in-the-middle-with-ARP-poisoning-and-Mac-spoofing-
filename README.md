# Man-in-the-middle-with-ARP-poisoning-and-Mac-spoofing-


This project aims to investigate and demonstrate how ARP poisoning and MAC
spoofing techniques can be leveraged to create a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack,
enabling unauthorized traffic interception and manipulation by circumventing
router-level blocking mechanisms. This project focuses on understanding ARP
protocol vulnerabilities, exploring practical MITM attack methods, and assessing
potential mitigation strategies for improved network security.

INTRODUCTION:

MAC Spoofing:
MAC Spoofing changes the MAC (Media Access Control) address on a device’s
network interface to appear as a different device. This can be used for security
testing, bypassing network restrictions, or mimicking another device on the network.
MAC addresses are unique identifiers for each network device, but they can be
altered using software tools. Spoofing your MAC address on Parrot OS is
straightforward and can be done through the terminal or with tools like macchanger.

ARP Poisoning:
In this project, we dive into the dynamics and potential risks of network security,
specifically focusing on Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks executed through
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning and MAC (Media Access
Control) spoofing. The goal is to understand and exploit vulnerabilities in ARP, a
foundational protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on local
networks, to demonstrate how attackers can intercept, manipulate, or reroute
network traffic.

Understanding ARP and ARP Poisoning
The Address Resolution Protocol is a key component in network communications,
enabling devices to locate and connect with each other by translating network layer
addresses (IP) to link layer addresses (MAC). This translation facilitates seamless
communication across networks. However, ARP has a major flaw: it was designed
without built-in security, making it susceptible to ARP spoofing or poisoning
attacks. In an ARP poisoning attack, the attacker sends falsified ARP messages onto
the network. These messages trick network devices into associating the attacker’s
MAC address with a legitimate IP address, thus routing the device’s traffic through
the attacker’s machine rather than directly to its intended destination.
Executing MITM Attacks Using ARP Poisoning and MAC Spoofing
In this project, we utilize Ettercap, a tool designed for network security
assessments, to demonstrate a MITM attack through ARP poisoning. Using Ettercap,
we simulate an environment where an attacker can intercept, alter, or drop data
packets between devices. By sending fake ARP responses, the attacker effectively
positions themselves between two or more devices, observing or modifying the data
in real time. Alongside ARP poisoning, MAC spoofing enables the attacker to
disguise their machine’s identity, further enhancing their access to restricted network
areas.

Significance of the Project

The project highlights both the technical process and the implications of MITM
attacks. MITM via ARP poisoning underscores the critical need for network
administrators to implement protective measures, such as static ARP tables, network
segmentation, and secure routing protocols. As a result, this project emphasizes not
only the importance of understanding network protocols like ARP but also the
potential risks if network traffic isn’t properly secured.
This hands-on exploration with Ettercap allows us to analyze network vulnerabilities
and understand the measures needed to mitigate them, making it valuable for both
